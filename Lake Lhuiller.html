                                   When I visited the home of Gladys for the first time, she told me about a nearby lake owned by the Lhuillier family. She mentioned its location, so I decided to fly my drone there. It was almost 3 km from her home. When I first saw it, the lake was truly a breathtaking place, like heaven. I promised her that one day we would go there together, but unfortunately, it's been a year, and it remains a distant dream because she was pregnant at that time.

                                   At work, I shared this story with my team leader, Melissa, who loves hiking with her friends. I told her about Lake Lhuillier in Pulangbato, describing its beauty in detail. She became interested and decided to share the idea with her friends. On February 10th, we discussed it and set a date for our hike: February 16th, Sunday. Everyone agreed, and we were all excited. I asked my partner Gladys if she would like to come with us, but she preferred to stay home and sleep, which I totally understood.

                                     When the day finally arrived, I woke up around 12 AM, even though our call time was 5 AM—yes, I was that excited. I messaged Melissa for an update, but she didn't respond. I told her that I would head to the meet-up place by 4:30 AM, but still, there was no response. At 5 AM, I messaged her again, saying that if they weren’t going to continue the plan, it was fine; I would just buy Jollibee and go back home. I was sad, thinking the lake visit wouldn't happen anytime soon, but I was ready to settle for Jollibee anyway, though still feeling down about it.

I explained that I thought they had canceled the plan, but she reassured me, saying, "That's not going to happen because we planned this already." I almost cried from relief. I quickly arrived at our meet-up spot, and we ordered food to fuel our hike.
