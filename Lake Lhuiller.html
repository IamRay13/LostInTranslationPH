                                   When I visited the home of Gladys for the first time, she told me about a nearby lake owned by the Lhuillier family. She mentioned its location, so I decided to fly my drone there. It was almost 3 km from her home. When I first saw it, the lake was truly a breathtaking place, like heaven. I promised her that one day we would go there together, but unfortunately, it's been a year, and it remains a distant dream because she was pregnant at that time.

                                   At work, I shared this story with my team leader, Melissa, who loves hiking with her friends. I told her about Lake Lhuillier in Pulangbato, describing its beauty in detail. She became interested and decided to share the idea with her friends. On February 10th, we discussed it and set a date for our hike: February 16th, Sunday. Everyone agreed, and we were all excited. I asked my partner Gladys if she would like to come with us, but she preferred to stay home and sleep, which I totally understood.

                                     When the day finally arrived, I woke up around 12 AM, even though our call time was 5 AM—yes, I was that excited. I messaged Melissa for an update, but she didn't respond. I told her that I would head to the meet-up place by 4:30 AM, but still, there was no response. At 5 AM, I messaged her again, saying that if they weren’t going to continue the plan, it was fine; I would just buy Jollibee and go back home. I was sad, thinking the lake visit wouldn't happen anytime soon, but I was ready to settle for Jollibee anyway, though still feeling down about it.

I explained that I thought they had canceled the plan, but she reassured me, saying, "That's not going to happen because we planned this already." I almost cried from relief. I quickly arrived at our meet-up spot, and we ordered food to fuel our hike.

                                  To be honest, I wasn't entirely sure about the trail because I had just searched it online and viewed it on Google Maps a handful of times to be sure. We started our hike around 6:30 AM, and I was glad there were lots of other hikers going to Budlaan and the same destination as us. That made me feel calmer. I opened my Google Maps to make sure we wouldn't get lost and was thankful that there were lots of locals to ask for directions.

                                     From bustling locals to a serene, quiet place, the first part of the trail was challenging because it was paved, but after reaching the Bonita Home for Girls, the road turned rocky and tranquil. We took photos, relaxed, and talked about funny "what if" scenarios like getting lost. After some time, we reached a gate with a "No Trespassing" sign. We didn't go beyond it but took photos outside the gate and decided to continue our hike. We met two teenagers along the way and asked if they were part of a group. They responded that it was just the two of them, enjoying their wanderlust.

                                   We continued our hike and reached a local's home. He gave us some information about getting to the lake and mentioned a helipad we could visit but warned us to be careful of the "No Trespassing" sign. We saw a group of hikers who didn't use the gate to enter but instead went around it. We decided to follow them and were rewarded with a stunning view, though the heat of the sun was exhausting and dehydrating. Luckily, I had brought Coke :D and Pocari Sweat to stay hydrated.
